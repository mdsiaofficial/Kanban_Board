Project 6 - Kanban Board

# Kanban Board Project

This project is a simple Kanban Board application. It allows users to create tasks, move them between different stages (Todo, Working, Done, Paused), and delete them. The tasks are draggable, making it easy to organize and prioritize them.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## What I Learned
- How to create a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- How to make elements draggable and handle drag and drop events.
- How to dynamically create and delete elements in the DOM.
- How to use event listeners to handle user interactions.

## Future Improvements
- Add a feature to edit tasks.
- Improve the design and layout of the application.
- Add user authentication and data persistence.

Feel free to contribute to this project or use it as a starting point for your own Kanban Board application!
